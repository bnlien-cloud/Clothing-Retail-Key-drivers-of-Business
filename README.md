### Recommendations
1) **Double down on high-performing locations** (e.g., Store 3 / Vancouver) with deeper inventory and spot promotions for the top products above.
2) **Optimize low-margin SKUs** (from the profit table) with bundle pricing or cost reductions.
3) **Use targeted discounts** for green/grey socks when volume uplifts offset margin cuts.
4) **Review shipping options** by city to reduce fulfillment cost or improve delivery speed.
5) **Investigate outliers** in very large orders and replicate successful campaigns.
